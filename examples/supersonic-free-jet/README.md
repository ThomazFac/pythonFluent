# Axisymmetric jet

Supersonic, 2D-axisymmetric free jet used for validating turbulence models in the high Mach number flow regime. Characteristic validation features are the Mach diamond position, amplitude and the logarithmic shear layer spreading rate in the outer jet region.
The case is based on a thermal spraying process called "cold spraying".
